        <h1>APJ Abdul Kalam</h1>
        <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
        <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, Madras Presidency (now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu).
            His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque,and his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
            His father owned a boat that ferried Hindu pilgrims between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi.
            Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and a sister in the family.
            His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land.
            Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women.
            The family business had involved trading goods and transporting passengers between the Indian mainland and the Pamban island and to and from Sri Lanka.
            With the opening of the Pamban Bridge connecting Pamban island to mainland India in 1914, the businesses failed.
            As a result, apart from the ancestral home, the other family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, and the family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born.
            As a young boy, he delivered newspapers to support the family's meager income.
            In his school years, Kalam got average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student and someone with a strong desire to learn by his teachers.
           He spent hours on learning mathematics.
           He completed his school education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram, and later graduated in physics from the St. Joseph's College in Tiruchirappalli in 1954.

        <h2>Personal Life and Interests</h2>
        <p>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d.1997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Lebbai (5 November 1916–7 March 2021),Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995).
            He was close to his elder siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older siblings, though he himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.
            Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle.He was a teetotaler, and a vegetarian.
            Kalam enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena (an Indian string instrument),and listening to Carnatic devotional music every day.
            He never owned a television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m.
            His personal possessions included a few books, a veena, clothing, a compact disc player and a laptop.
            He left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother after his death.           
            Kalam set a target of interacting with 100,000 students during the two years after his resignation from the post of scientific adviser in 1999. He explained, "I feel comfortable in the company of young people, particularly high school students. Henceforth, I intend to share with them experiences, helping them to ignite their imagination and preparing them to work for a developed India for which the road map is already available."
            His dream is to let every student to light up the sky with victory using their latent fire in the heart.
            He had an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology such as developing biomedical implants.
            He also supported open source technology over proprietary software, predicting that the use of free software on a large scale would bring the benefits of information technology to more people.
        </p>
        <h2>Religious and spiritual views</h2>
        <p>Religion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout his life.
            He was a practising Sunni Muslim, and daily namaz and fasting during Ramadan were integral to his life.
            His father was an imam of a mosque, and had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children.
            His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue.
            As Kalam recalled: "Every evening, my father A. P. Jainulabdeen, an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, and a church priest used to sit with hot tea and discuss the issues concerning the island."
            Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous issues lay in "dialogue and cooperation" among the country's religious, social, and political leaders.
            Moreover, since Kalam believed that "respect for other faiths" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, and he remarked: "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool."
            One component of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in India, and an enduring aspect of his legacy, is the syncretism he embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and cultural traditions of India.
            In addition to his faith in the Quran and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions, learnt Sanskrit and read the Bhagavad Gita.
            In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming the president, he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating that "During the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of all religions ... and I would like to endeavour to work for bringing about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country".
            Describing Kalam as a unifier of diverse traditions, Shashi Tharoor remarked, "Kalam was a complete Indian, an embodiment of the eclecticism of India's heritage of diversity".
            Former deputy prime minister L. K. Advani concurred that Kalam was "the best exemplar of the Idea of India, one who embodied the best of all the cultural and spiritual traditions that signify India's unity in immense diversity.            
            Kalam's desire to meet spiritual leaders led him to meet Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the Hindu guru of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), who Kalam would come to consider his ultimate spiritual teacher and guru.
            Kalam and Pramukh Swami met eight times over a fourteen-year period and on his first meeting on 30 June 2001, Kalam described being immediately drawn to Pramukh Swami's simplicity and spiritual purity.
            Kalam stated that he was inspired by Pramukh Swami throughout their numerous interactions, and recalled being moved by Swami's equanimity and compassion, citing this incident as one of his motivations for writing his experiences as a book later.
            Summarising the effect that Pramukh Swami had on him, Kalam stated that "[Pramukh Swami] has indeed transformed me. He is the ultimate stage of the spiritual ascent in my life ... Pramukh Swamiji has put me in a God-synchronous orbit.
            No manoeuvres are required any more, as I am placed in my final position in eternity."

        <h2>Post-presidency</h2>
        <p>After leaving office, Kalam returned to teaching, and became a visiting professor at various institutions.
           He became a visiting professor at IIM Shillong,an honorary professor at his alma mater Anna University in Chennai,and an honorary fellow of the Indian Institute of Science at Bengaluru.
           In September 2007, he became the first chancellor of the newly established Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology at Thiruvananthapuram.
           He also conducted lectures for management students in India,and visited China twice at the invitation of the Chinese government to conduct sessions at the Peking University.
           In 2011, Kalam voiced his support towards the establishment of the nuclear power plant at Koodankulam in Tamil Nadu, giving assurances for the safety of the facility.
           However, some of the locals were unconvinced by his statements on the safety of the plant, and were hostile to his visit.
           In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme called What Can I Give Movement aimed at the youth of India with a central theme of defeating corruption.

            In 1997, he was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.
