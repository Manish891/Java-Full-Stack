            and sometimes falling on the road
            and getting hurt near my left eye as i fell sideways.</pre></p>

        <p><sup>During my inter in chaitanya college many times</sup><mark>during which the college should not be open and we went to college someone used to call the ABVP Bandh fellows </mark> they would come and argue with the floor head and send us home by giving that day as holiday and sometimes when they conduct tests on the days we consider as holiday then the bandh fellows would tear the papaers and we would be happy.</p>
        <h5>College Life</h5>
        <p>During my college we were having so much fun like copying answers from mobile during the lab internal and external exam and do collaborative version for the internal exam like to copy answers from everyone.</p>
